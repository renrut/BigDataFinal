# BigDataFinal
Final project for Vanderbilt Big Data CS3892. 
#Goal
The goal of this project is to accurately predict which NBA teams will make it to the playoffs using data pulled from ESPN.com, Wikipedia, Twitter, and other news sources.

#Model
Our model is a work in progress, but we use player and team popularity, team streakiness, injuries, player records, and playoff history from previous seasons.
